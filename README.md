# Mispriced_Diamonds - Exploratory Data Analysis
This is an exploratory analysis of diamond pricing data to identify patterns in pricing, outliers, relationships, and potential mispricing across clarity categories.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
3. Run the Jupyter notebook

## Assumptions
- Identical diamonds may legitimately exist
- Outliers may represent valid but rare observations
- Outlier filtering is used for interpretability, not deletion

## Aggregated Views
- Summary statistics by clarity
- Outlier impact analysis
- Filtered correlation and pricing relationships
